In Swift:  

[1] 
Create a function that would take in valid String inputs and determine if they are a palindrome or not.  This mean that the forward and backwards output of the string are both the same.

Example Input:  
 - anna --->  TRUE
 - Anna  ---> False
 - racecar -- > true  --> racecar 

**note**
you cannot use any helper functions or methods.  Example, you cannot use 'count()', 'split()', 'reversed()' methods in your solution.  You would need to develop your own logic.

Bonus:  Using the logic you created, implement an iPhone (swift) app that takes in a String input and prints out if it is a palindrome or not.

[2]
Given a 2D Array, determine if the values starting from position (0,0), will be multiplies 2x of itself going vertical and across.

Sample input 2D array:

[2] [4] [8] [16] [32] 
[4] [8] [16] [32] [64]
[8] [16] [32] [64] [128] 

Sample output:
Return:  True


Requirements:
[1] Function is able to take in any array size
[2] Only integer values
[3] No helper functions

[3]
Given a String, remove duplicate characters in that String and print out the unique characters

Example Input:
 - I want to be an Engineer  --->  Iwogir
