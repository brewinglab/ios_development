Technical questions in Swift

Requirements:

 - [1] Function is able to take in any array size

 - [2] Only integer values

 - [3] No helper functions
__________________________________________________________________________

**[1]** 

Create a function that would take in valid String inputs and determine if they are a palindrome or not.  This mean that the forward and backwards output of the string are both the same.

Example Input:  
 - anna --->  TRUE
 - Anna  ---> False
 - racecar -- > true  --> racecar 

**note**
you cannot use any helper functions or methods.  Example, you cannot use 'count()', 'split()', 'reversed()' methods in your solution.  You would need to develop your own logic.

Bonus:  Using the logic you created, implement an iPhone (swift) app that takes in a String input and prints out if it is a palindrome or not.

**[2]**

Given a 2D Array, determine if the values starting from position (0,0), will be multiplies 2x of itself going vertical and across.

Sample input 2D array:

[2] [4] [8] [16] [32] 
[4] [8] [16] [32] [64]
[8] [16] [32] [64] [128] 

Sample output:
Return:  True

**[3]**

Given a String, remove duplicate characters in that String and print out the unique characters

Example Input:
 - I want to be an Engineer  --->  IwobEgir

**[4]**

Given two sorted arrays of arbitrary size, return a final complete ordered array from smallest to largest numbers.

Example Input:

 - input_1 = [4,6,9,10,11,15]
 - input_1 = [5,7,12,13,14,16]

 Output:

 - final = [4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]

 **[5]**

 Given the [iOS_food] app, complete the application so that the application can function accordingly.
