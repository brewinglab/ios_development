In Swift:  

[1] 
Create a function that would take in valid String inputs and determine if they are a palindrome or not.  This mean that the forward and backwards output of the string are both the same.

Example Input:  
 - anna --->  TRUE
 - Anna  ---> False
 - racecar -- > true  --> racecar 

**note**
you cannot use any helper functions or methods.  Example, you cannot use 'count()', 'split()', 'reversed()' methods in your solution.  You would need to develop your own logic.
